In Jonasâ€™s world, everything is controlled, and there are no colors or emotions. The people follow strict rules and are deprived of their individuality. Jonas is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memory. The Giver shows him memories of the past, full of feelings, colors, and love. Jonas learns that his community hides the truth to avoid pain. He also learns about "release," which means killing people, including babies. When Jonas finds out baby Gabriel will be released, he decides to escape with him. They leave the community, traveling through harsh weather and cold. Jonas protects Gabriel and keeps him warm. At the top of a hill, Jonas sees a house with lights. He hears music, feeling hope and love for the first time.
